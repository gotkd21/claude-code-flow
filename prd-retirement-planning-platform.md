# PRD: Personal Retirement Planning Platform

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This product is a comprehensive personal retirement planning platform designed to securely track and analyze financial portfolios for long-term retirement planning. The system addresses the need for a unified, secure platform that can track multiple asset types across various accounts, perform Monte Carlo simulations for retirement scenarios, and serve as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI-powered financial analysis.

**Goal:** Create a secure, local macOS-based platform that tracks joint financial assets from 2022-2070, performs sophisticated retirement planning analysis, and integrates with AI tools for enhanced financial decision-making.

## 2. Goals

1. **Data Security:** Implement enterprise-grade security using macOS keychain for encryption key management
2. **Comprehensive Tracking:** Track all asset types (stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, properties, 401k) across multiple accounts for both spouses
3. **Automated Updates:** Automatically update stock prices via free APIs and support quarterly manual updates for other assets
4. **Monte Carlo Analysis:** Perform sophisticated retirement planning simulations with configurable market and inflation assumptions
5. **MCP Integration:** Serve as a backend data source for AI-powered financial analysis tools
6. **Historical Analysis:** Track performance changes over time starting from 2022 early retirement date
7. **Tax Strategy Modeling:** Support Roth conversion scenarios and different tax-advantaged account strategies

## 3. User Stories

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Estate planning features:** Inheritance planning, charitable giving optimization
- **Life insurance modeling:** Integration of life insurance policies in planning
- **Real-time trading:** Direct integration with brokers for executing trades
- **Tax filing integration:** Automatic tax document generation or filing
- **Multi-user sharing:** Support for financial advisors or family members beyond the couple

- **Social features:** Sharing or comparing portfolios with other users
- **Debt management:** Tracking and optimization of loans, mortgages, or credit cards

## 6. Design Considerations

- **UI Framework:** Consider SwiftUI for native macOS experience or Python-based GUI for rapid development
